# Aliens Exist

From the late 2000s to the mid-2010s, I worked as a molecular biologist for a national security contractor in a program to study Exo-Biospheric-Organisms (EBO). I will share with you a lot of information on this subject. Feel free to ask questions or ask for clarification.

**Discussion :table:**

It seems like all my comments are being deleted. I will post answers at the end of the message.

From the late 2000s to the mid-2010s, I worked as a molecular biologist for a national security contractor in a program to study Exo-Biospheric-Organisms (EBO). The aim of the program was to elucidate the genome and proteome basis of these organisms. Although the study of EBOs has been going on for decades in other programs, the new high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies of the late '90s unblocked stagnant research in this area. Since then, several breakthroughs have led to significant advances in our understanding of the genome and proteome of these beings. What we've learned so far has enabled us to outline some disconcerting perspectives about our place in this universe. Briefly, we've discovered that the EBO genome is a chimera of genomes from our biosphere and from an unknown one. They are artificial, ephemeral, and disposable organisms created for a purpose that still partially eludes us. I'll be substantiating my statements after a brief introduction.

## Story #2: Personal Encounters and Visions

I don't normally comment on x, just lurk most of the time, but I saw this thread and figured why the fuck not I'll post.

I had 3 different events, might have to post them separately, might not post all of them if I get tired of typing, I suck at green-text btw so I'll just type it out.

### Event 1: Precognitive Drawings

The first event I had was when I was a kiddo, although I didn't realize it until I was older, but my parents and schoolteachers did.

Before 9/11, I was always (ALWAYS) drawing cities, and would put the twin towers in them burning, although I was like 4 at the time and I had never even seen them or heard of them. I did this in my agenda notebook, on the desk, on paper at home, all the time. Nobody thought anything of it until 9/11 happened and then everyone was very quiet around me. They would try to be really nice to me, they wanted me to draw something other than burning towers. They never told me what, they just told me to draw whatever I wanted. Don't really remember much beyond that though.

Fast forward about a decade and a half, I find my old agenda notebooks in the closet, and see 9/11 scribbles all over them from time periods far before 9/11. I finally went and asked my parents about it and they were extremely squirmy on the subject, but finally they had told me that I was drawing all of this before 9/11 and that they were hoping I would just forget. They had told me that my mother apparently predicted a bunch of plane crashes between the '60s and the '80s to excruciating detail (down to the exact locations they would hit), although she lost this ability when I was born.

Apparently, my grandmother and my great-grandmother had the same ability to varying degrees. It's really made me question a lot of shit ever since though, to the extent that I seriously worry about my own thoughts.

### Event 2: Apocalyptic Dreams

Significantly after this, but before re-discovering this weird life event of mine, I had another incident take place.

I had the day off and had gone to sleep, although once I had awakened in my dream I didn't realize I was asleep.

I lived out day after day, week after week, month after month in this dream that I didn't even know was a dream. However, it was not a good one.

### Part 2 of the Last Story

If you killed yourself to escape, it wouldn't work. They could reanimate the dead and keep you on some sort of life support for the sake of experimentation. I don't know why or how, but somehow I knew that if they took you, you were theirs forever. There was no escape.

### Part 3 of the Last Story

But anyways, me and my wife in the blue dress were walking down the road. There was a small ditch on the left side, with a few alligators in it, and a line of trees on the other following the ditch. We were walking home, and there were bits of these spacecraft everywhere. The sun looked like it was setting but it wasn't (damaged or something as I stated in previous post). But we finally got home; it was getting close to nighttime.

### Event 3: Encounter in the Wilderness

I'd say I was around 9 or 10 when it happened. I was spending summer vacation with my uncle who lives in the country. Talkin so rural there aren't neighbors, pole lights, or another building for a good 20-30 miles in any one direction. I was out hiking and trying to find something to do because the country is boring as shit sometimes.
