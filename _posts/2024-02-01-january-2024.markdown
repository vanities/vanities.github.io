### Books Reading:
[Deadhouse Gates: Malazan Book of the Fallen, Book 2][dhg] by Steven Erikson - Sporadically listening to this on Audiobook, it's so good. Ongoing. ★★★★★<br>
[Service Design: From Insight to Implementation 1st Edition][sd] by Andy Polaine, Lavrans Løvlie, & Ben Reason - Read this as a recommendation from a designer for Book Club at Ford. Decent book reflecting the differences between products and services. ★★★

### Games Playing:
WoW Season Of Discovery! Still!<br>
Palworld came out and I played like an hour of it.<br>
Enshrouded looks cool.


### Log:
Feel so much better this month, not much congestion or coughing. Solomon is talking so much now, can point to things and tell me about it and about his day. He tells us when he's excited and when food is "the best everrr!" At night, we've been putting him down by going in together and singing, "Jesus loves me", "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes", and "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", then he turns over in his blanket and tells us "Goodnight!" Took December and most of January off from lifting and running, it's been too cold outside. Angela was off for snow January 16th - 23rd, the most I've seen in a while for consecutive days off. Slipped on ice and hit some dude's truck with my Tacoma trying to go to church, so have to get that fixed :/.
