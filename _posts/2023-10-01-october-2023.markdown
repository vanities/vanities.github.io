### Books Reading:
[The Sword of the Lictor][sol] & [The Citadel of the Autarch][coa] by Gene Wolfe - Okay, so the first two books were amazing, Sword of the Lictor is pretty awesome too. The last book, Citadel of the Autarch, wraps everything together in an incredibly mind bending way. 10/10<br>


### Games Playing:
WoW Wotlk, Baldur's Gate 3


### Log:
Well, it cooled down and I got the flu for the first week of October, then had allergies for the other two next weeks. Resorted to Nyquil then Claritin.
