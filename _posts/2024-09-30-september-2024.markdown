### Games Playing

[The Legend of Zelda: Dungeons of Infinity](https://justinbohemier.wixsite.com/portfolio/game-design)
This game is a procedurally-generated rogue-like ‘Link to the Past’ dungeon crawler. It’s not a rom hack, it was created in Gamemaker Studio from scratch using the original assets. Many new features and assets were added to this game, but special care was put in to ensure it still looks, feels, and plays like the original game.

Terraria, again, with friends. Setup T-Mod sever on my NAS with unraid

### Log

Month of the Spider.

Was sick from August 27th - September 3rd, still feeling residual sickness on the 5th, making it tough to exercise. Finally better and working out almost 2 and half weeks later

I’ve been telling Solomon stories at night about Randy’s adventures. I came up with a genius idea to do them in the story of Zelda Ocarina of Time dungeons lol. So last night Randy went to the Deku tree and fought the big spider and got the slingshot, tonight he went into Zora’s domain and into JabuJabu’s belly to fight the electric jellyfish, got the boomerang, and saved the Zora princess.

I re-did my whole nvim, switching from custom stuff with Plug to lazy.nvim, holy shit what have I been doing. Also been learning about all the new python stuff with ruff and uv. It's like I've been living in a swift black hole the past few years.
