Creating a planting calendar for your vegetable garden in Tennessee involves considering both the cool-season crops (like spinach and kale) and warm-season crops (like tomatoes and corn). Tennessee spans USDA Hardiness Zones 6-8, which means planting times can vary slightly depending on your specific location. Below is a general guideline for both cool and warm-season vegetables you mentioned, based on the middle of Tennessee (Zone 7), to help you start planning.

# Spring

Spring officially begins with the vernal equinox, which typically occurs around March 20th or 21st. In Middle Tennessee, spring weather can start to be felt as early as late February. The last expected frost date is typically around **April 15th** in Middle Tennessee

## February
This begins the planting of the nightshades and broccoli indoors.

### Bell Peppers
Start seeds indoors about 8-10 weeks before the last expected frost date, so **February 1st - 15th**.

### Tomatoes
Start seeds indoors about 6-8 weeks before the last spring frost date, so **February 15th - 28th**.

### Broccoli
Start seeds indoors about 6-8 weeks before the last spring frost date, so **February 15th - 28th**.

## March
This is the Spring time to sow greens.

### Spinach
Sow seeds directly **March 20th - 25th**, as spinach prefers cool temperatures and can germinate in soil as cold as 35°F.

### Kale
Sow directly outdoors from March to May. Preferred moon cycle: **April 8th - 10th**

## Carrots
Sew directly **March 26th - 27th**

## April

### Zucchini
Sow seeds directly into the ground 1-2 weeks after the last frost date when the soil has warmed, so **April 22nd - 30th**. Zucchini matures quickly, so you can also do a second planting in early July for a late summer harvest. Ensure the soil temperature has warmed to at least 60°F. Zucchini plants are prolific, so stagger planting every 2-3 weeks to ensure a continuous harvest throughout the summer.

### Broccoli
Transplant them **April 8th - 10th**.

## May
End of the month is when we transplant or plant the nightshades. Corn

### Corn
Direct sow seeds outdoors after the last frost when the soil has warmed to at least 60°F, **May 7th - 8th**. Corn needs warm soil and plenty of sunlight, so it's essential to wait until the conditions are right.

### [Tomatoes][tomato]
Transplant middle to end of May. If you purchase established seedlings from a nursery, you can directly transplant them.

### Bell Peppers
Transplant middle to end of May. If you purchase established seedlings from a nursery, you can directly transplant them.

# Summer

Summer officially begins with the summer solstice, around June 20th or 21st. In Middle Tennessee, summer temperatures can start to rise significantly by late May or early June.

## June
Harvest and weed.

### [Pumpkins][pumpkin]
Plant your pumpkins between **June 15 – July 10**. Plant in full sun with lots of room.

For ornamental gourds, go for “Daisy,” “Tennessee Spinning,” or a gourd seed mix for a collection of gourd varieties.

For carving jack-o-lanterns, “Jack-o-lantern” (yes, that’s really the name!) and “Howden” varieties are great for carving.

For baking, sugar varieties like “Baby Pam,” “Autumn Gold,” and “Fairy Tale” are easily accessible options. “Cinderella,” “Lumina,” “New England Pie Pumpkin,” and “Long Island Cheese” are other recommended baking varieties.


## July

### [Brussels Sprouts][bs]
Sew directly **Jul 7th - 21th**. Brussels sprouts require a long growing season (100 days), so they can withstand light frosts and improve in flavor after exposure to cooler temperatures. Choose varieties like Prince Marvel, Jade Cross, and Lunet.

## August
This is the Fall time to sow greens.

### Spinach
Sow seeds from August to October. Spinach can tolerate light frosts, making it ideal for late-season planting.

### Kale
Sow seeds from July to August. Kale can survive frosts and even become sweeter in taste afterward.

# Fall

Fall officially begins with the autumnal equinox, around September 22nd or 23rd. In Middle Tennessee, temperatures start to cool down noticeably by early to mid-October.

---

# Winter

Winter officially begins with the winter solstice, around December 21st or 22nd. In Middle Tennessee, temperatures can start to drop significantly by late December or early January.
