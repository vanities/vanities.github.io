### Books Reading:
[Memories Of Ice: Malazan Book of the Fallen, Book 3][moi] by Steven Erikson - Continues to be a work of poetry. The character development is amazing. ★★★★★<br>
[Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones][ah] by James Clear - this was the second or third self-help timemanagement book we read. The first half had some good quotes, not so much the second half. ★★★<br>

### Games Playing:
WoW Season Of Discovery! Found a different guild, Warrior/Mage<br>


### Log:
I took a long time off from writing, I'm now trying to catch up on Jun 27th. Obviously things were pretty slumped this year with everything that happened.

For our friends meet up, we went to Pinkerton park in Franklin, it was so nice to see my highschool friends again, along with all of our kids hanging out.
