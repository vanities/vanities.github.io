### Books Reading:
[The Ministry for the Future][mof]: Liked the Ministry for the future. Felt bad for frank. The ending was interesting, felt a little out of place, but glad it ended on a good note. Was interesting how they felt jaded about the celebrations for Gaia at the end.
[The Lean Startup][lean]: Re-read this after five years. A legendary book, has Farb in it.


### Log:
The third week in August began getting so hot, hard on my running times and endurance. This morning at 7am I saw steam rising off the blacktops. Feels like 100 with 50% humidity. Solomon is stringing words together, "Hi Daddy", "mmmmH Good Pizza!". Today he was playing with a toy and simulating it down a blanket and said "Weeee! Slide". He does like slides.
