Based on excerpts from [this forum post][r] of a person claiming to be a Rothchild.

Do not see your life as a compartmentalized time unit. You are part of a stream...a river....flowing through the veins of your ancestors and future progeny.

Like it or not, you owe a debt to those who came before and a greater debt to those yet to come. Yet you squander your little energy and few neurons railing on about things for which you have no knowledge!

At least go out to the motorway and collect empty soda cans for scrap. You will have at least made SOME contribution then as critical thought is not your long suit.

You cannot un-ask a question. Once it is put out there, it has to be dealt with on its own terms.

The act of "selflessness" is just that...an act. Programming put out by various self interested parties and institutions. It does not exist in Nature, which is where you need to take your cues from.

When one accumulates a surplus of resources, why would it be "human nature" to release these to an unrelated other without parity consideration? You likely notice that so called benefactors of one form and another do receive compensation of sorts...peer recognition, status and, almost always, some form of quid pro quo...unseen and withheld from the unwashed masses.

Selfishness and selflessness are artificial constructs! Please provide one such example of selflessness occurring in Nature...even one! Existing outside of the bloodline, that is.

When a hawk captures a field mouse and feeds its young, no one thinks anything to be amiss. Clearly, the hawk benefits by protecting its progeny, the young benefit by virtue of surviving and only the mouse, in its death, loses.

Was the mouse selfless in its sacrifice? Not quite...it was stupid (in being exposed) and had insufficient defenses to protect itself. The parent mice spent their lives doing things other than teaching the young how to avoid hawks.

In terms of your second question, the bloodline can be traced back to the very beginning. Because YOU cannot do so, or do not attach significance to recording and disseminating such information, does not mean others act the same way!

Notice that in the Old Testament, a significant amount of detail is accorded to the lineage in the very beginning. Have you bothered to read this? Have you wondered why it was so important that it receives so much attention in such a revered document?

Of course, were you to understand the importance of bloodlines, you would know that, uniformly, family clans in both east and west regard bloodlines to be the determinant of station, position and inheritance. Royalty descends from royalty. Peerage, and all that.

Slaves of all sorts and colors also, and usually in vain, tried to keep track of the history of their families. Mormons are doing thins in the United States, and have noted that various "interest groups" have been noted to be introducing "noise" into the process.

I wonder why that would be??

I readily acknowledge that fiat is an illusion. I have stated that clearly and repeatedly. Many are aware, but yet continue to make it the central focus of their insect-like existence.

You must learn to differentiate between self-delusion and observing the delusions of others. Where do you, and I, fit in that equation?

All potential flows from the bloodline. Potential must be realized! A turbine can spin an AC generator, but useful work will not be realized unless there is a corresponding LOAD. No point creating energy and sending it to GROUND.

Real wealth is a subjective concept. Some are satisfied to accumulate massive numbers of fiat, or DEBT INSTRUMENTS, and turn their backs on their bloodline, thinking family no longer matters. How many times has that scenario played out?

Every human must determine for themselves what constitutes wealth. A philosopher may value an ascetic life...placing his or her time above the accumulation of physical possessions. Perhaps he or she will come to great understandings which benefit his progeny!

A BANKER may most highly value the subjugation of others, for whatever reason.

A politician craves an adoring crowd and the access it brings.

Would a million fiat "promises to pay" and a girlfriend, freely provided, complete your quest? So it would seem, as that is the only real tangible request you have made...and with such a POTENTIAL valuable resource at your disposal.

Sex and money....quite novel, actually. Who would have thought it?

You comment on your addictions to media distractions, and have correctly noted that your progeny have the same predilections. I would assume that you have made the connection between these two facts!

Think of how the very young learn languages from their parents. Mimicking the sound pattern and watching the actions and reactions from word patterns, facial expressions and tone. Dogs are trained the same way of course.

Children have a functioning command of language before general structured education begins. Of course, in general, what is taught is a REINFORCEMENT of what the young have already learned. The same takes place in social mores and expectations as well. The parents are PROGRAMMED to teach their young certain patterns of belief and society, through religion and media REINFORCE these mental constructs.

Harvard did a 30 year study tracking the progeny of various segments of society to confirm or refute the "beautiful lie" of the american dream...wherein it is held that anyone can aspire and rise to any level of society. While there are notible standouts to every finding, statistically, young humans generally track their parents in the major socioeconomic indicators to a highly statistically significant level. In other words, no-one is going anywhere, but the DREAM of things being otherwise is most useful!

Do you know, sir, that the percentage of serfs signing 30 year mortgages who actually READ the document is statistically ZERO? Even the most educated amounst you do not read a document which will consume over 30% of your working life income? Amazing to most!

I assume the above will answer your question(s) relating to children and the education of them. YOU alone, will set their trajectory and define their life. Choose wisely!

Memories are accumulated experiences, without the timeline component most assign. You survive because you ALREADY access these data, although you may be unaware. Think of all the functions the subconscious manages without your conscious thoughts (respiration, muscle movement, heart beat, etc). Subconscious also regulates your stored experiences and DNA history. Sad that the subconscious is an ALIEN aspect of your being!

You are genetically predisposed to survive NOW, and you do that very well. For those still predisposed to linear time, research the work of Dr Otto Warburg and the cellular research he completed in the 1930's. He demonstrated that the cells live indefinately until the local environment becomes fouled! Imagine that! One lives until they drown in their own filth! Curoiusly, his work was done on CHICKEN cells...Laughing out Loud!

Most true and EASY to understand!

Note that I have already provided the receipe for immortality, freely and without obvious gain. Note also that this GIFT was generally met with scorn, derision and disbelief! What many would consider the most precious of gifts...swept aside and largely ignored!

While I am not at all surprised, it is baffling how stupid humans have allowed themselves to become.

As to the balance of your questions, they have already been addressed or are inane and not worthy of my attention.

Keep in mind that, in your linear time perception, it will require 6 months to two years to receive the full benefits you are just now starting to realize. Each and every cell in your body will regenerate over the two year period and you will be "re-birthed" as a new human, in line with the original objectives given freely to you, and others so willing.

Your blood will be completely rejuvenated and your life trajectory altered in a most positive sense. You will not know sickness, depression or sadness. You will be prepared for any impediments which may come your way and see, as we do, that these are LEARNING EXPERIENCES which greatly benefit YOU and your PROGENY. You will ultimately gravitate to other like minded humans and find a suitable mate who shares your philosophy of life. Your family will be healthy and strong as those OTHERS will fall by the wayside. You will see this for yourself!

The truly amazing thing is that you need not search for ENLIGHTENMENT...it will find YOU! Be diligent in your studies! Devote the majority of your waking hours to study as it will pay you back one-million-fold! Do not engage in drudgery and do not accept "work" which does not fulfill your mind and spirit!

Note that the plant book was written in the 1980's. Would you not expect that such research would be taught in every so called institution of higher learning? Note also that you have seen, for yourself, the POWER which RIGHT LIVING imparts. Despite your PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE, one of your "peers" has already tried to cast doubts upon what you yourself have learned. Try to explain why a human would try to dissuade you from helping yourself instead of learning the WAY and benefiting themselves? DO not grow angry at those who choose to ignore WISDOM and realize that they, themselves, choose to remain enslaved. FREE WILL affords them this RIGHT!

Hm, since humans only act in enlightened self interest, what is your gain from helping this person to continue his/her path? And what is your gain from imparting your wisdom to this forum? Please do not take this question as a sign of ingratitude.

How large is the bloodline? Is it like your immediate family, and extended family, or is it something like entire races?

How many different bloodlines are there on earth? I somewhat remember your earlier post about possible bloodlines that someone belonged to, and I cannot remember exactly but I think I counted up to 7-10 bloodlines that was listed on this forum. Is that all the bloodlines on earth?

When one person of one bloodline marries another person of another bloodline which bloodline does the child belong to?

Does your bloodline marry inside the bloodline only?

If I were to decide to live on a self sustaining life with my family/bloodline and other people in my family/bloodline would not want to participate for what ever reason, should I just...sorta leave them off the 'list' for lack of better words and just start the bloodline "enlightenment" on my own and eventually distance myself from my other bloodline members who do not respect the bloodline so that way I can instill absolute obedience in my children without interference?

Any Information regarding to how to start getting the whole family, not just myself, into this bloodline perfection would be great. Yes I know you covered a lot of information on this topic but most of your messages seem to be directed to the individual improvement, and directly their children, not about their own parents, other living relatives etc, you know what I mean? I hope I am clear enough.

The COLLEGE process is but a form of bondage or slavery befalling the middle class progeny. Either the family, or the offspring, incur enormous expenses for dubious benefits. Note that almost all graduates from University still are woefully ignorant of financial issues, know how to read a contract...etc...etc. The importance of the STUDENT DEBT as a tool of enslavement cannot be overstated. Savvy observers have already noted that STUDENT DEBT cannot be extinguished through the bankruptcy process...curious WHY that would be? Take the advice of a wise man who once admonished others to "follow the money". In this case, Goldman Sachs will be one of the firms found at the trails end. STUDENT DEBT is a huge expense, a huge profit for some and literally KILLING the middle class once and for all.

If one wishes to be educated, there are myriad ways to accomplish the acquisition of a REAL education. For those too stupid to see through the educational sham, it is their choice and their fault. None others...and the juice from this particular fruit will be VERY bitter for those who choose to partake.

The Income Tax "system" is an intellectual construct designed to obfuscate and confuse...and it has been wildly successful. It is one of the main reaping/harvesting devices.

In order to understand the system of confiscation, you must have a cursory understanding of contract law, which is remarkably easy to obtain if one is willing to turn off the idiot tube and apply ones self to the acquisition of knowledge. Doubtful.

Second is the understanding of the fact that words mean things. Further, words are empty vessels to which meaning can be filled. Under contract law, words carry the meaning that the contract drafters assign. Read a REAL contract and you will see that, after the recitals, generally come definitions. What are definitions, you ask? Whatever the contract drafter SAYS they are.

Example, you are writing a contract that says "The word GREEN, for purposes of this agreement, shall be held to mean RED", as defined by a standard Pantone color chart. You sign this contract in order to obtain a drivers license, and have therefore accepted this meaning of the word green. Chances are that you did NOT read the contract, but merely signed the form that the drivers license official stuck in front of you and told you to sign. SHEEP!

You are subsequently ticketed by a corporate armed militia employee and charged with running a green light. You go to the local court and become tongue tied trying to unravel a Gordian know of nonsense.

Good luck with that one.

There are ALWAYS ways to avoid the trap. I have already explained this in great detail, and most of your other questions as well. Why do you not take the time to READ AND LEARN?

Your question about men forcing women is STUPID to the extreme! A woman will follow a man if he is deemed worthy of following. Are you worthy of following? DO you have requisite skills? Are you a good provider? Can you provide a safe environment? Do you demonstrate courage and leadership under fire?

Certainly not. Most relationships in the first world countries are not based on these traits, and thus do not survive the onslaught which comes later.

Seemingly you do not grasp the basics, and are not in a state of readiness to learn important information. COme back when you are so prepared.
