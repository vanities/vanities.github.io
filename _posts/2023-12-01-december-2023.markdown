### Books Reading:
[Gardens of the Moon (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, Book 1)][gotm] by Steven Erikson - Such a great book. I tried picking this series up multiple times, but this time I have conviction. So many characters all doing things all at once, I never could predict what was coming next. ★★★★

### Games Playing:
WoW Season Of Discovery


### Log:
Got kinda sick, had the sniffles for a few weeks during the holidays. Solomon has been speaking in full sentences: "I don't wanna go to sleep, I don't wanna take a nap" And some others. During the Christmas break he was so much fun. The break in general was a good time away from work and a blessing to spend with my family.
