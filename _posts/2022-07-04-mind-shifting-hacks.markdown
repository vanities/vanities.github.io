# Perception Shifting Hacks

## Summary
These are a list of positions you can take in your mind that radically shift your perception on life.

### Talk to one another as if you were talking to your grandmother.
Frame of mind: Replace the person you talk to with your grandmother or some other person who you consider to be the most loved person in your life.
- Would you curse at your grandmother?
- Would you use courteous language to your grandmother? (Yes ma'am, No ma'am)


### [Treat one another as if you would want the other person to want to be in a relationship with you.][relationships]
Frame of mind: Replace the other person with someone who does amazing things for you.
- Would you always help a friend when they ask?
- If your relationship with your partner wanes, wouldn't it be best to continue doing significant things for them?

### [Treat yourself as if you were a child that you are taking care of.][child]
Frame of mind: Replace yourself as a healthy child of which you would be inherently more strict for.
- Would you let a child you were taking care of eat unhealthy foods?
- Would you let a child stay up late at night playing video games?
- Would you let a child shirk on their responsibilities?
