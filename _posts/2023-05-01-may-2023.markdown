### Games Playing:
None

### Books Reading:
[The Frugal Wizardâ€™s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England][fw] by Brandon Sanderson - a neat separate work from Sando's secret books. Completely different from his cosmos.<br>
[Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Day][sprint] - Jake Knapp et. all - decent book about agile and sprints within a week. Ford required reading, I think The Lean Startup better<br>


### Log:
Been mowing in my EV zero turn, so that's been fun. Created a set of tools for myself to automate torrenting tools.
