### Books Reading:
[American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company][ai] by Bryce G. Hoffman - I really wanted to read the full book, got about halfway and was laid off. Honestly, I see a lot of similarities between the complications during 2008 and now, especially with honesty in leadership. Great book though. ★★★★<br>
