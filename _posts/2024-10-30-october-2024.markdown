### Music Listening

spoiler: october is for jazz, but didn't listen to too much this month

[Flying Lotus - Spirit Box](https://flyinglotus.bandcamp.com/album/spirit-box-2) - is the GOAT of modern awesome jazzy hip hop stuff ★★★★

[Godspeed You! Black Emperor - “NO TITLE AS OF 13 FEBRUARY 2024 28,340 DEAD”](https://godspeedyoublackemperor.bandcamp.com/album/no-title-as-of-13-february-2024-28340-dead) - of course bands still want to make a political statement about shit they probably dont really need to, but that's art amirite? master classes of slow buildup shoegaze. ★★★

### Games Playing

[SMT3: Notcurne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_III:_Nocturne)

- [Metaphor: ReFantazio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor%3A_ReFantazio) - this game is way easier than nocturne, but way more accessible.

- the hardest rpg I've ever played if played on hard. I liked this [dudes video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E821pIXqY2g).

### Log

A taste of cold weather, only to be bombarded with last minute bugs, once again.

We had a great halloween with Solomon dressing up as the red ranger, it rained quite a bit, but we still got out and had a great time.
