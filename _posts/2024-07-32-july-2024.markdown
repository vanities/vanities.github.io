### Log:

4th of July was great, shot off like $1k total of fire works between my neighbor and I. Solomon burned his hand on a sparkler.

Been listening to a lot of Joe Rogan since he's back on the youtube, along with Tucker Carlson, who has apparently surpassed Rogan in viewers.

KT #672 - DONALD TRUMP (SHANE GILLIS) + JOE BIDEN (ADAM RAY)

This episode is the funniest thing on the internet- hands down.

This month, I started picking some carrots. End of July I really should have picked the corn. By August the corn started to die.
