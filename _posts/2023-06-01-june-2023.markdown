### Games Playing:
WoW classic hardcore w/ friend: super fun. Our first run was Warrior (me) / Shaman (him) and we died at 18 in The Barrens. Nowere doing duo gnome mage.<br>
Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom: Mostly watching my wife play this, not really interested in re-finding the same map and recollecting hearts and stamina.<br>

### Books Reading:
[Snow Crash][sc] by Neal Stephenson -


### Log:
Went to [AWE][awe] for Ford, was a cool conference where Neal Stephenson spoke at. Their decentralization section wasn't very good, but it was a really cool AR/VR experience.
