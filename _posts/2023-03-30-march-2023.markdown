### Games Playing:
Hogwarts Legacy for PC
And VR Games with my Nephew


### Books Reading:
[Dawnshard][ds] by Brandon Sanderson - a Novella before Rhythm of War that I'm catching up on.<br>
[Tress of the Emerald Sea][tress] by Brandon Sanderson - both this and the book above are about sailing. Great book with a cool magic system with the spores. It caught me in very quickly and I read it like an addict.<br>
[Raising Good Humans: A Mindful Guide to Breaking the Cycle of Reactive Parenting and Raising Kind, Confident Kids][humans] by Hunter Clarke-Fields MSAE - interesting take on meditaiton, mindfulness and control of your emotions as a parent.<br>
[Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed or Fail][ray] by Ray Dalio - Very similar to Peter's book I read a month ago, better, I think. More interesting philiosophical, less data points<br>
