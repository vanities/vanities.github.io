### Games Playing:
Kings Field I & Kings Field IV - great ps1 and ps2 games from [fromsoftware][fs].

Next up is going into Nexus and Last Raven. I need to beat the hard ones >:)

### Books Reading:
Swiss Family Robinson - Christian-tier learnings about how to raise sons.

### Log:

Made it the whole year without coffee. Drinking a cup now.

Learned how to smoke ribs and am smoking pork butt right now.

Put up a perimeter fence around our property to keep the dogs and foxes out.
