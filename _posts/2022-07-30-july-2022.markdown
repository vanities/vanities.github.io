### Log:
This month I joined open3 as a Senior Software Engineer, working on the architecture of their client and backend admin. After my first week of being able to work in a React, NextJS, and Redux environment, I began the journey of mastering one of the holes in my software career: building responsive websites. I've built robust backends and iOS apps with complex logic and tons of tests, but never a react app. So this is a wonderful learning experience as you may see in the computing category! The team is also very active and inspiring, it's been a wonderful couple weeks with them so far.

Smoked a side of a salmon with:

1. Curing for 8 hours
- 1 1/2 salt
- 1 1/2 brown sugar
- some garlic powder

2. Drying in the fridge 8 hour by washing the salt and brown sugar and wrapping in plastic wrap
3. Smoking for 4 hours.
