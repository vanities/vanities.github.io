# Reverse Osmosis Water

## Description
In a world where the essentials of life - **water**, food, and shelter - are often taken for granted, the quality of what sustains us comes sharply into focus. Water, the source of all life, stands at the forefront of our health and wellbeing. Yet, not all water is created equal. This blog is dedicated to the advocacy of Reverse Osmosis (RO) water, a beacon of purity in the murky waters of contamination. Here, we delve into the essence of what it means to truly nourish ourselves and protect our health. From stripping harmful contaminants to delivering water in its most pristine form, RO water is more than just hydration; it's a commitment to living a cleaner, healthier life. Join us as we explore the critical importance of quality water, the foundation upon which all else rests, and why RO water is integral to not just meeting, but elevating, the basic human necessity for pure, life-giving water.


## Instructions
Every year, replace the first 3 pre stage filters for the RO and dump the water out for 5 minutes see:
