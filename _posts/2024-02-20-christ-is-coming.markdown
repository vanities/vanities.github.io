> 8 Again, God said to Noah and his sons:  
> 9 I am going to make a solemn promise to you and to everyone who will live after you. 10 This includes the birds and the animals that came out of the boat. 11 I promise every living creature that the earth and those living on it will never again be destroyed by a flood.
>
> 12-13 The rainbow that I have put in the sky will be my sign to you and to every living creature on earth. It will remind you that I will keep this promise forever. 14 When I send clouds over the earth, and a rainbow appears in the sky, 15 I will remember my promise to you and to all other living creatures. Never again will I let floodwaters destroy all life. 16 When I see the rainbow in the sky, I will always remember the promise that I have made to every living creature. 17 The rainbow will be the sign of that solemn promise.

These verses are a beautiful reminder of God's promise not to flood the earth again. Yet some wonder if other cosmic or cataclysmic events might challenge or reinterpret that promise.

### The Magnetic Pole Shift and Tidal Waves

According to some researchers like [Ben Davidson](https://twitter.com/SunWeatherMan) of SpaceWeatherNews, if or when the magnetic poles shift, there could be a massive global upheaval. He discusses this in detail in his [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvjJqIXYT1w&t=1167s), suggesting that a large-scale pole shift might trigger huge tidal waves or sloshing events that could threaten humanity. Does this contradict God's promise? Or is this phenomenon something else entirely—maybe a cyclical event that stops short of a complete global wipeout?

### The Ed Harris Image and Jimmy Carter UFO Rumors

There's an image circulating quoting Ed Harris, a NASA Ames Research Associate, talking about an incident involving President Jimmy Carter. The rumor is that Carter, a deeply religious man who had also reported seeing a UFO, was allegedly brought to tears after being briefed on certain classified UFO material. Supposedly, it touched on how major religions (including Christianity) were programs created by extraterrestrials to control society.

The story might sound wild, but it taps into the broader discussion of whether religion and alien phenomena intersect. While no official source confirms Carter’s emotional response, conspiracy theorists see it as proof that behind the scenes, world leaders are aware of a hidden alien narrative. Are angels and demons, as described in religious texts, actually extraterrestrial beings? Could Christ himself have been an alien visitor bringing higher knowledge to humanity? These questions, while provocative, remain deeply speculative.

### Angels, Demons, and the Alien Connection

1. **Angels and Demons as Aliens**: Some theories propose that what ancient texts call “angels” could be benevolent extraterrestrial entities imparting wisdom. Conversely, “demons” might be malevolent aliens meddling in human affairs.
2. **Christ as an Alien**: Another fringe idea suggests that Christ’s miraculous acts (healing the sick, resurrection) might have been advanced technologies beyond our understanding. In this narrative, Christ came from “the heavens” in a very literal sense, and his message was one of universal peace and enlightenment.
3. **Archetypal Imagery**: UFO sightings, near-death experiences, and visions of angels or demons share similar archetypal motifs across cultures. Could these phenomena be pointing to the same source—an advanced intelligence that has been interacting with humanity throughout history?

### Concluding Schizo Thoughts

Are these theories truths hidden in plain sight, or just creative attempts to reconcile faith with unexplained phenomena? Maybe the pole shift warnings are unrelated to God’s promise, or maybe they represent a lesser but still dangerous cosmic event. Meanwhile, the Ed Harris rumor about Jimmy Carter continues to intrigue UFO enthusiasts who believe the government has far-reaching knowledge of alien involvement in shaping religion.

At the end of the day, whether angels and demons are truly interdimensional or extraterrestrial beings, or whether Christ himself might have come from beyond Earth, is a matter of personal belief and faith. The conversation invites us to explore our spiritual texts, scientific theories, and cultural myths, always seeking deeper understanding of our place in the cosmos.
