## Summary
Went down a rabbit whole of smoking meat, started off smoking salmon, then moved to pig and cow. Got a pellet smoker from my grandparents for free. Found out offset smokers are the best for flavor, but require more attention tending to the fire, I might get one later.

None of these recipes are my own, mostly stolen from [Mad Scientist BBQ][msbbq].

With the large meats, they can be frozen for 6-12 months. For every 5lbs, they will need a full day in the freezer to dethaw. After defthawing, red meats will stay for up to 5 days in the fridge.


1. Salmon

Watched this [video][salmon], got some ideas from the chef. He cures the fish for a lot longer than prescribed by other recipes online.But here's my recipe. The single biggest problem in smoking salmon is too high heat. If you've ever seen salmon "bleed" a white, creamy substance, that's a protein called albumin. If you see lots of it, you've screwed up; a little is normal. After an hour in the smoker, baste the fish with birch or maple syrup, or honey; do this every hour.

- 1/2 Salt 1/2 Brown Sugar Mixture, coat the salmon in this and cure for 12 hours in fridge
- Wash the salmon and pat dry and let dry for 12 hours in fridge
- Smoke at 225°F for 4 hours
- Look for internal temp of 130°F to 140°F


2. Pork Spare Ribs

This [video][porkribs] is what got me into this guy. Made these for Christmas dinner, which was a hit.

- Season 1/2 salt & 1/2 pepper mixture
- 4 hours in the smoke at 225°F, start spritzing non-fat sides w/ 1/2 vinegar 1/2 water solution every 15-20 minutes after the 3rd hour
- Put 4 heaping scoops of pig lard in aluminum pan to smoke
- Increase temp to 275°F for 1 hour to enhance pull-back effect
- Wrap ribs in smoked lard butcher paper
- Put on smoker for ~30 minutes, pull at ~207°F internal or when meat has the probe resistance of softened butter
- Glaze ribs (if desired) and put back on smoker until sticky

3. Pork Butt

Commonly known as pulled pork, very easy to make and hard to mess up. This [video][porkbutt] is crucial.

- Score fat & season w/ rub or just salt & pepper
- 3 to 4 hours in smoker at 250°F
- After 3 to 4 hours spray with apple cider vinegar solution (avoid spraying fat) and continue to spray every 30 - 45 minutes until wrapping
- Note: at this point Jeremy checked his internal temp which was around 156°F, the target temp before wrapping is around 170°F
- After 6 hours in the smoker check internal temp, if your temp is close to 170°F and your finger sinks into fat when you poke it, then it is time to wrap
- If not leave it on the smoker until desired temp is reached and fat is rendered
- Wrap tightly in 2 layers of heavy duty aluminum foil and place the wrapped meat back on the smoker (still 250°F) or in oven (at 250°F)
- About 2 hours after wrapping, check temp, the target temp is 203-204°F
- Note: the internal temp and feel of the meat (i.e. probes like butter) are the most important indicators that your meat is done cooking
- When meat is done cooking let it rest for at least 1 hour
- Remove the bone and shred/pull apart pork as you want it to avoid drying it out

4. Whole Chicken

Not really much smoke can be applied to chicken, but if you can make it juicy, crispy, and smoking, you win. Here's the [video][chicken] on that.

- Cut around neck and butt
- Season with 1/2 salt and pepper
- 200°F/225°F for 2 hours
- 325°F for 15 minutes
- Look for internal temp of 165°F
