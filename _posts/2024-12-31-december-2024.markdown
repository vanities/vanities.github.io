### Music Listening

Not really music, but... [Alzabo Soup](https://www.alzabosoup.com/) - podcast where we literally become our favorite authors by devouring portions of their brains. We analyze engrossing speculative fiction with a chapter-by-chapter focus on acclaimed author Gene Wolfe. - this podcast is so good at breaking down Gene Wolfe ★★★★★

### Books Reading

- [Wind and Truth by Brandon Sanderson][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wind_and_truth] - My favorite ongoing epic fantasy by one of the best in the game. Kaladin is my favorite, obviously, I finished it and the ending was meh. Idk, too many loose ends. ★★★

### Games Playing

- [Super Mario Wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._Wonder) - Been trying to finish this with Solomon, he's been getting better at pushing the right and jump button.
- [Mario Party Jamboree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Party_Jamboree) - Had fun unlocking the new maps and characters, better than some of the other newer mario parties.
