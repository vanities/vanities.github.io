# June 2022 updates

### Books Read:
[Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design (Robert C. Martin Series)][clean-arch]
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Uncle Bob books are always good, learned a lot about Programming Paradigms (Structured Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Functional Programming), Design Principles ([SOLID][solid]), Component Principles (Cohesion and Coupling), Independence, Boundaries & Policy, & finally, architecture components that are details (The web, what kind of database, what framework).

### Compute:
- worked on the first 3 chapters of [speedrun-eth][eth], which is a series of programming exercises to learn how to create full-stack projects that can create nfts, tokens, and how to stake.
- I got to re-learn how to use LaTeX and created a [LaTeX form of my Resume][resume].

### Log:
This month I took off from work mostly after being reduced to part-time at Fun. Spent a lot of time with Solomon and Angela as we went to Perdido Key, Florida, near Pensacola. We went to the Naval Museum there, which was a treat and saw the Blue Angles fly. [Watched SGDQ and got to see them run a giant Arbitrary Code Execution on Zelda 64.][zelda]
