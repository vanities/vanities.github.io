To bake pumpkin seeds, you'll want to preheat your oven to around 300-325°F (150-160°C). Here's a simple recipe to follow:

1. **Clean the Seeds**: Remove the seeds from the pumpkin, and rinse them thoroughly to remove any pulp and strings.

2. **Boil and Salt**: Boil the seeds in salted water for about 10 minutes. This helps to soften the seeds and infuse them with flavor. Use about 2-3 tablespoons of salt per 2 cups of seeds.

3. **Dry**: Drain the seeds and pat them dry with a paper towel or kitchen towel.

4a. **Savory Season**: Toss the seeds in a bit of oil (like vegetable or olive oil) and salt, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne.

4b. **Sweet Season**: Toss the seeds in a bit of coconut oil with chocolate, honey, nutmeg, and cinammon.

5a. **Bake**: Spread the seeds in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-30 minutes, or until they're golden brown and crispy. Be sure to stir or shake the seeds on the baking sheet every 10 minutes for even cooking.

5b. **Airfry:** Put in for 15 minutes @ 350.

6. **Cool**: Let the roasted pumpkin seeds cool before enjoying.

Remember that cooking times can vary depending on your oven and the size and thickness of the seeds, so keep a close eye on them to prevent burning.
