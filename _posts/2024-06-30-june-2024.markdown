### Books Reading:
[House of Chains: Malazan Book of the Fallen, Book 4][hoc] by Steven Erikson - Just started this one, the new Teblor characters are awesome ★★★★★<br>
[Four Thousand Weeks][ftw] by Oliver Burkeman - a short and sweet book that had a ton of good quotes and story. ★★★★★<br>

### Games Playing:
Elden Ring: DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, AWESOME! I did realize that I like the anime fights less than the slow methodical Dark Souls 1 combat.

### Log:

Kale started getting eaten by bugs pretty bad at the end of June, I opened the chickens to get in there and eat the bugs. We got another low yield after, but it's mostly gone.

Sunsets in June
