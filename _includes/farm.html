    <h2>Chickens - <i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i></h2>
    Chickens require the least maintenance of the flock. They run down our hill
    when they see us come outside, flapping their wings, gliding down, sometimes
    to flight. We let them roam freely within our backyard fenced in area. The
    rooster protects them by alerting for hawks and finds them food by
    scratching and foraging. You never want more than one rooster per half a
    dozen hens or so, or else they'll fight, but you want them around for their
    great defensive properties. Some were hand raised and are quite friendly,
    happy to eat right out of your hand or jump in your lap.

    <h3>Barred Rock</h3>
    Is what we call them in Tennessee, their full name is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Rock_chicken"
      >Plymouth Rock</a
    >. Looking similar to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gray">California Gray</a>
    or a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_chicken">Dominique</a>,
    some of them actually might be mixed. They are
    <font color="black" style="background-color: white">black</font> with
    <font color="white" style="background-color: black">white</font>
    spots and stripes. Very sweet chickens, definitely one the smarter types.
    One of ours has learned to climb our goat fence by hooking her feet into the
    second to last top rows and hopping over to get more food outside our fence
    and is able to get back in when she wants as well. They enjoy being hand fed
    treats of meal worms, dried corn, and seeds.

    <h3>Rhode Island Red</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island_Red">Reds</a>, like
    their name implies are very
    <font color="red" style="background-color: blue">red</font> in coloration.
    Some of the breeds we have maay be considered
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_chicken"
      >New Hapshires</a
    >. These chickens are very commonly owned and widely recognized. They lay
    medium sized
    <font color="brown" style="background-color: #aad3e3">brown</font> eggs.
    When hand raised and fed they are some of the most friendly chickens you
    will ever meet. They enjoy perching on hands and shoulders. Three of our
    Rhode Island Reds were hatched and hand raised by a 3rd Grade class at the
    previous Elementary School my wife worked at. They are also mixed with
    Americana and Brahma's, which is why their feathers have a slight sheen to
    them that is not commonly found on Rhode Island Reds.

    <h3>Ameraucana</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameraucana">America!!!</a> The males
    rare proud, strong, confronters. They are great scavengers for their hens
    and great protectors, calling out when predators like hawks are seen. We
    have a female <b>splash</b> type, named Freckle, that has a splash of
    <font color="black" style="background-color: white">black</font> colors on
    her grayish white feathers and she lays
    <font color="blue" style="background-color: red">blue</font> eggs.

    <h3>Silkie</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silkie">Silkie's</a> are a very
    fluffy and funny looking chicken. Ours is
    <font color="white" style="background-color: black">white</font>, but they
    can come in all different colors, but all have
    <font color="blue" style="background-color: red">blue</font> skin. Given
    their furriness, they are incapable of flying. They're very smart and fast,
    but docile. When mixing with the flock, they are generally loners, often not
    interacting with the others.

    <h3>Bantam</h3>
    Tiny chickens! The
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantam_(poultry)">Bantam</a> are cute
    smaller than half the size of a normal chicken. They routinely jump through
    our gate doors and fence openings. They come in different color feathers,
    ones we've had were
    <font color="yellow" style="background-color: blue">yellow</font>/<font
      color="white"
      style="background-color: black"
      >white</font
    >
    and <font color="brown" style="background-color: #aad3e3">brown</font>.
    Their eggs are tiny, about half as big as regular chicken eggs, but still
    just as good. Will be the lowest on the pecking order if left with their
    bigger-sized flock.

  <div class="ducks">
    <h2>Ducks - <i>Anas platyrhynchos domesticus</i></h2>
    Ducks were our second flock type, they quickly became my favorite because
    they greet you with large motioning tail wagging and happy loud quaking. I
    tend to quack back at them or make excited sounds and they perk up very
    fast. They love it when they have a clean water pond to clean themselves and
    play. An easy way to tell between male and female are their quacks. Drakes
    will make a neutral sound that sounds more guttural, think Donald Duck.
    Females make the onomatopoeia <b>*quack*</b> sound. Males also sometimes
    have a curled back feather and broader heads.
    <br />

    <h3>American Pekin</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pekin">American Pekins</a>
    are probably what you think of when you think of a duck, considering how
    well-known Donald Duck is. They are a sleek
    <font color="white" style="background-color: black">white</font> color, that
    when comparing their feather in front of a snowy background, have a
    <font color="lightyellow" style="background-color: darkblue"
      >yellowish</font
    >
    tint.

    <h3>Khaki Campbell</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaki_Campbell">Khaki Campbell</a>
    Are the other type of duck that may come to mind easily, they're usually a
    mix of colors of
    <font color="brown" style="background-color: #aad3e3">brown</font>,
    <font color="green" style="background-color: magenta">green</font>,
    <font color="tan" style="background-color: #2d4b73">tan</font>, and

    looks very similar to a

    <h3>Blue Sweedish</h3>
    They're definitely a hue of blue! They are very calm, but sometimes loud
    when walking past them as to get your attention.
