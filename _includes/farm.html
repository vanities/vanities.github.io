    <h2>Chickens</h2>
    Chickens require the least maintenance of the flock. They run down our hill
    when they see us come outside, flapping their wings, gliding down, sometimes
    to flight. We let them roam freely within our backyard fenced in area. The
    rooster protects them by alerting for hawks and finds them food by
    scratching and foraging. You never want more than 1 rooster per half a dozen
    hens or so, or else they'll fight, but you want them around for their great
    defensive properties.

    <h3>Barred Rock</h3>
    Is what we call them in Tennessee, their full name is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Rock_chicken"
      >Plymouth Rock</a
    >. Very sweet chickens, definitely one the smarter types, one of ours has
    learned to climb our goat fence by hooking her feet into the second to last
    top rows and hopping over to get more food outside our fence. She's smart
    enough to get back in when she wants as well.<br />

    <h3>Bantam</h3>
    Tiny chickens! The
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantam_(poultry)">Bantam</a> are cute
    and routinely jump through our gate door. Their eggs are tiny, about half as
    big as regular chicken eggs, but still just as good. Will be the lowest on
    the pecking order if left with their bigger-sized flock.<br />

    <h2>Ducks</h2>
    Ducks were our second flock type, they quickly became my favorite because
    they greet you with large motioning tail wagging and happy loud quaking. I
    tend to quack back at them or make excited sounds and they perk up very
    fast. They love it when they have a clean water pond to clean themselves and
    play. An easy way to tell between male and female are their quacks. Drakes
    will make a neutral sound that sounds more guttaral, the females sound like
    what you think a duck would sound like. Males also have a curled back
    feather.
