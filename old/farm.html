    <h2>Chickens</h2>
  Chickens require the least maintenance of the flock. They run down our hill when they see us come outside, flapping their wings, gliding down, sometimes to flight. We let them roam freely within our backyard fenced in area. The rooster protects them by alerting for hawks and finds them food by scratching and foraging. You never want more than 1 rooster per half a dozen hens or so, or else they'll fight, but you want them around for their great defensive properties.

      <b>Barred Rock</b>
      Is what we call them in Tennessee, their full name is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Rock_chicken"
        >Plymouth Rock</a
      >. Very sweet chickens, definitely one the smarter types, one of ours has learned to
      climb our goat fence by hooking her feet into the second to last top rows
      and hopping over to get more food outside our fence. She's smart enough to
      get back in when she wants as well.<br />

      <b>Bantam</b>
      Tiny chickens! The
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantam_(poultry)">Bantam</a> are
      cute and routinely jump through our gate door. Their eggs are tiny, about
      half as big as regular chicken eggs, but still just as good. Will be the
      lowest on the pecking order if left with their bigger-sized flock. Baby

    <h2>Ducks</h2>
    Ducks were our second flock type, they quickly became my favorite because they greet you with large motioning tail wagging and happy loud quaking. I tend to quack back at them or make excited sounds and they perk up very fast. They love it when they have a clean water pond to clean themselves and play. An easy way to tell between male and female are their quacks. Drakes will make a neutral sound that sounds more guttaral, the females sound like what you think a duck would sound like. Males also have a curled back feather.
